# HIP: An Open Source Protocol for AI Agent Hyperlink Interpretation

> **Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI Agents often struggle to interact with hyperlinks when they lack direct browser control. The Hyperlink Interpretation Protocol (HIP) provides a standardized, open-source framework for agents to intelligently parse, interpret, and access resources linked in documents, spreadsheets, and other structured data—bridging a critical gap in modern agentic workflows by offering an open agent protocol for hyperlink resolution and resource validation.

## Overview

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Draft (open for contributions)  
**Author:** Daniel T. Sasser II  
**Project:** Gorombo Agent Framework

## Purpose

The Hyperlink Interpretation Protocol (HIP) was born from limitations observed in agentic workflows when an AI agent needs to access and verify resources linked within a document but lacks the ability to "click" or directly browse the hyperlink. This protocol provides a structured, logical path for an agent to use its available tools—such as targeted search APIs or file system access—to resolve the link's destination and perform a given task (e.g., confirm file existence, read content).

HIP is designed to make web automation and data interaction more robust and reliable for LLMs and other autonomous systems that lack native hyperlink execution capabilities.

## Use Cases

HIP is designed for any scenario where an AI agent interacts with structured data containing hyperlinks. Key use cases include:

✅ **Verifying File Existence:** Confirming if a linked file (e.g., `draft.md`) exists in its expected folder or shared drive.

✅ **Content Retrieval:** Accessing and summarizing the content of a linked document, article, or file.

✅ **Workflow Automation:** Allowing an agent to follow a chain of linked resources to complete a multi-step process or perform reasoning.

✅ **Data Validation:** Ensuring that links in a manifest, spreadsheet, or index file point to actual, accessible resources.

## Protocol Structure & Process Flow

The protocol operates through a logical five-step process that adapts based on the hyperlink's format and context:

1. **Parse**  
   The agent extracts the target path, domain, file name, or reference from the hyperlink string.

2. **Determine Route**  
   Based on the link’s structure and context (e.g., a Google Drive URL, internal folder, IPFS CID), the agent selects the appropriate method or tool (e.g., Google Drive API, file system reader, search engine).

3. **Resolve**  
   The agent attempts to access the resource using the selected route. This includes managing authentication, permissions, and fallback attempts when necessary.

4. **Perform Task**  
   Upon resolution, the agent executes the required task—whether confirming existence, reading contents, or summarizing data.

5. **Confirm & Log**  
   The agent logs the action and result (success/failure) and returns relevant output to the user or calling system.
