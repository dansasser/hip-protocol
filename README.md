**HIP is a lightweight, open protocol that enables AI agents and LLMs to resolve and interpret hyperlinks without browser control.**

## 🔍 What Is HIP?

The **Hyperlink Interpretation Protocol (HIP)** empowers agents to interact with hyperlinks in structured files (like spreadsheets, documents, and markdown) where traditional "click" actions are unavailable.

Agents using HIP can:

✅ Parse and understand embedded hyperlinks  
✅ Resolve and verify linked resources intelligently  
✅ Automate workflows across Google Drive, Markdown, and local systems  
✅ Log results, maintain memory, and handle fallback behavior  

> Instead of relying on brittle scraping or browser emulation, HIP uses structured logic and existing APIs for reliability and autonomy.

## 📖 Documentation

The full protocol specification is located in [`HIP.md`](./HIP.md). It includes:

- Problem overview and rationale  
- Five-step agent process model  
- Key use cases  
- Citation format and licensing  
- Visual flow diagram of HIP logic  
- Contribution guidance  

> 📊 *A mermaid-based diagram of the 5-step HIP logic is available in the main protocol file.*

## 🚀 Why This Matters

LLMs and AI agents are increasingly deployed in research, productivity, and automation contexts—but most can’t “click links.” This limits access to cloud files, markdown references, and local resources.

HIP offers a practical solution.

Rather than hardcoding logic or emulating browsers, HIP provides a standardized, reusable process for hyperlink interpretation—boosting success rates, reducing fragility, and enabling deeper contextual understanding across agent workflows.

## 🔗 Live Use Case

HIP is actively implemented in the **Gorombo Agent Framework**. It enables agents to:

- Sync local folders with Drive  
- Interpret spreadsheet indexes and file manifests  
- Automatically validate article metadata and file structure integrity  

This real-world use showcases HIP’s value in agent-based systems design.
